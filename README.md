# 15. Task 15. Helping Custom GPTs Avoid Hallucinations by Collecting Information First

When we use generative AI like GPTs, sometimes it makes things up. This is called hallucination. The AI might give an answer that sounds right but isn't true. This happens because the AI doesn't have all the information it needs. To stop this from happening, we need to make sure the AI gets all the information before it tries to solve the problem.

Key Ideas
Information First: Always get the information before trying to solve the problem.

Avoid Assumptions: Don’t let the AI guess; it should gather facts first.

User Context: Understand where and how the problem is happening.

Preferences: Know what the user likes or needs.

Past Interactions: Remember what the user has done or asked before.

Desired Outcome: Know how the user wants the answer to look.

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Gather Information

Ask for details about the problem and the user's preferences. This helps in understanding the full context.

Example:

![image](https://github.com/iahalkhatib/ChatGPT-Making-Custom-Ai-Assistants/assets/170050432/1eab7ebd-1b85-48a5-a412-5151d6cace0f)

Step 2: Confirm Information

Make sure the AI repeats the information back to the user to confirm everything is correct.

Example:

![image](https://github.com/iahalkhatib/ChatGPT-Making-Custom-Ai-Assistants/assets/170050432/ba0ba8bd-65a1-49ce-8500-0d77be984c91)

Step 3: Solve the Problem

Once everything is clear and confirmed, the AI can then try to solve the problem.

Example:

![image](https://github.com/iahalkhatib/ChatGPT-Making-Custom-Ai-Assistants/assets/170050432/ebf03d8b-e52c-431a-9a19-d6df1d8a0015)

Benefits

Accuracy: By gathering all the needed information, the AI avoids making things up.

Better Answers: Users get more accurate and helpful responses.

User Involvement: Users stay engaged and confirm the information, leading to better solutions.

By collecting and confirming information first, we can make sure the AI gives accurate and helpful answers. 

This method stops the AI from making guesses and ensures it works with all the facts, making the problem-solving process much better and more reliable.

# 16. Task 16. Using the Flipped Interaction Pattern

When building custom GPTs, one of the most powerful prompt patterns is the Flipped Interaction Pattern. 

Instead of just telling the GPT what to do or asking it questions, you can ask it to ask you questions to help achieve a goal. This approach is especially useful when the user doesn't know what information is needed to solve a problem.

Key Ideas
Ask Questions: The GPT asks you questions to gather necessary information.
User Engagement: The user provides answers, helping the GPT understand the context better.
Achieve Goals: The GPT uses the gathered information to help achieve a specific goal, like creating a recipe or solving a problem.
Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Set the Goal
Tell the GPT what goal you want to achieve and ask it to gather the necessary information by asking questions.

# 17. Task 17. Format of the Flipped Interaction Pattern

When using the Flipped Interaction Pattern, you set up a prompt that instructs the GPT to ask you questions to gather the necessary information. Here's how you can structure it:

State the Goal: Clearly specify what you want to achieve.

Set the Condition: Define when the GPT should stop asking questions.

Optional Instructions: You can specify the number of questions to ask at a time and prompt the GPT to start.

Key Statements

Goal: "I would like you to ask me questions to achieve X."

Condition: "You should ask questions until condition Y is met."

Optional: "Ask me the questions one at a time, two at a time, etc. Ask me the first question."

Replaceable Elements

X: Replace with the goal, such as "creating a meal plan" or "creating variations of my marketing materials."

Y: Replace with the condition, such as "until you have sufficient information about my audience and goals" or "until you know what I like to eat and my caloric targets."

This method ensures accuracy and relevance, making the GPT more effective in helping users.

# 20. Task 20. Making Custom GPTs with Features

Just like software, we can create custom GPTs with different features that users can turn on or off. 
This makes the GPT more useful and flexible. Let's see how we can use the flipped interaction pattern to ask users about their preferences and then give them answers based on what they want.

Adding Features to Custom GPTs
We can add features to a GPT to make it do more things. Here's an example:
Feature: Create an FAQ entry for each question and answer.

Some users might want this feature, while others might not. So, we’ll start by asking the user if they want to enable this FAQ feature.

Example: Enabling and Disabling the FAQ Feature

Goal: Add a feature that creates an FAQ entry and let the user decide if they want to use it.

Prompt Setup

![image](https://github.com/iahalkhatib/ChatGPT-Making-Custom-Ai-Assistants/assets/170050432/3f529254-6129-4ebb-8fb8-75787363314c)

![image](https://github.com/iahalkhatib/ChatGPT-Making-Custom-Ai-Assistants/assets/170050432/1c1df3e6-2f3a-45a2-bdda-9bc1efa8142a)

Example Conversation with the Feature
Initial Question:

User: "Can I get reimbursed for renting a scooter for my business trip?"
GPT: "Before I answer your question, would you like to enable the FAQ feature?"
User's Preference:

User: "Yes, I would like to enable that feature."
GPT: "Thank you. Let's see if you can get reimbursed for renting a scooter."
Answer and FAQ Creation:

GPT: "According to the policy, you cannot get reimbursed for renting a scooter for a business trip."
GPT: "FAQ Entry: Can I get reimbursed for renting a scooter for my business trip? Answer: No, according to the policy, it is not reimbursable."
Without FAQ Feature:

User: "Can I get reimbursed for renting a scooter for my business trip?"
GPT: "To provide the most accurate information, I can check the company policy for you. Would you like me to enable the FAQ feature?"
User: "No."
GPT: "According to the policy, you cannot get reimbursed for renting a scooter for a business trip."

By using the flipped interaction pattern, we can ask the user what features they want to use at the beginning of the conversation. This makes the GPT more flexible and tailored to their needs. For example, we can ask if they want to create FAQ entries or if they have other preferences. This way, we can provide a more customized and useful experience for the user.

# 21. Task 21. Setting Boundaries for Custom GPTs

When creating custom GPTs, it's important to set boundaries to ensure they work as intended. 

Boundaries help the GPT understand what it should and shouldn't do, especially when things don’t go as expected. 

Here’s how to think about and set boundaries for your custom GPT.

Why Boundaries Matter
Boundaries prevent the GPT from:

Doing tasks it's not supposed to do.
Misinterpreting user requests.
Generating incorrect or harmful content.

Examples of Setting Boundaries

Example 1: Generating Images

Problem: A user might ask the GPT to create an image of their kitten, which isn't its purpose.

Boundary: The GPT should not generate images or prompts for generating images.

Prompt Setup:

Implementing Boundaries
Here’s how you can implement these boundaries:

Setting Boundaries in the Custom GPT
Define What It Should Not Do:

Clearly outline the tasks that are outside the GPT's scope.
Clarify Ambiguous Requests:

Make sure the GPT asks for clarification when a request is unclear.
Provide Safe Responses:

Offer predefined responses for requests that fall outside the boundaries.

Setting boundaries is essential for ensuring your custom GPT performs well and safely. By defining what the GPT should and shouldn't do, you help it provide accurate, helpful, and appropriate responses. 
This process involves thinking through potential issues and clearly outlining the GPT's scope and limits.

# 22. Task 22. Handling Ambiguity in Custom GPT Knowledge Bases

When building a custom GPT with a knowledge base, it's essential to handle ambiguity effectively. Ambiguity arises when the policy or information is unclear or when the user's question doesn't match the provided information precisely. Let's walk through how to manage these situations using a travel policy example.

Why Ambiguity Happens
Ambiguity can occur due to:

Unclear Policies: Policies might not cover every possible scenario.
User Queries: Users might ask about situations not explicitly mentioned in the policy.
Example: Vanderbilt Travel Policy
Imagine you have a custom GPT designed to answer questions about Vanderbilt's travel policy. The policy document doesn't mention "Southwest Business Select," leading to different interpretations.

Inconsistent Responses
GPT Version 1:

User: Can I get reimbursed for Southwest Business Select?
GPT: Vanderbilt travel policies specify that travelers must purchase the lowest available coach or airfare class. Upgrades, such as Southwest Business Select, are generally considered a personal expense and are not reimbursable.
GPT Version 2:

User: Can I get reimbursed for Southwest Business Select?
GPT: Under the Vanderbilt travel policy, you can be reimbursed for Southwest Business Select.
These differing responses illustrate the ambiguity.

Steps to Handle Ambiguity
Identify Ambiguity:

Define what constitutes ambiguity. For example, a situation where the policy doesn't directly address the user's question.
Set Boundaries:

Establish rules for the GPT to follow when it encounters ambiguous situations.
Provide Clear Instructions:

Instruct the GPT on how to handle ambiguous queries.
Defining Ambiguity and Boundaries
Ambiguity: A situation where the policy does not clearly state the answer.
Boundary Rule: If the policy does not directly answer the question, the GPT should not infer an answer.
Example Instructions for the GPT
Ask for Clarification:

If the policy is unclear, ask the user for more details.
Prompt: If the information is not clear, ask the user for more context about their question.
Refer to Support:

Direct the user to contact a support desk or refer to a human for clarification.
Prompt: If the policy does not clearly answer the question, direct the user to contact support.
Offer Alternatives:

Provide alternative solutions based on clear policy statements.
Prompt: If the specific request is not addressed in the policy, suggest alternatives that are clearly allowed.
Implementing Instructions
Example Setup
Define Ambiguity:

Prompt: Ambiguity means a situation where the policy does not provide a clear answer or requires inference.
Boundary Instructions:

Prompt: If there is no direct statement in the policy that clearly answers the question, refer the user to support.
Handling Unclear Queries:

Prompt: Always ask for more context if the user's question is ambiguous.

Implementing in Practice
To put this into practice, you need to integrate these instructions into your custom GPT's prompt. Here's how you can format it:

By setting clear instructions and defining boundaries, you ensure your custom GPT handles ambiguity effectively, providing users with accurate and helpful responses even when the information is not straightforward. 
This approach not only enhances the user experience but also builds trust in the GPT's reliability and accuracy.

# 23. Task 23. Making Custom GPT Interactions Clearer

When we're building custom GPTs, users might ask questions that aren't very clear. This can make it hard for the GPT to give the right answer. One way to handle this is to use the question refinement pattern. This pattern helps the GPT suggest a better version of the user's question, making it clearer and easier to answer correctly.

How the Question Refinement Pattern Works
Analyze the Question: The GPT looks at the user's question.
Suggest a Better Version: The GPT suggests a clearer version of the question.
Ask for Confirmation: The GPT asks the user if they'd like to answer the refined question instead.
Setting Up the Custom GPT
We can instruct the custom GPT to use this pattern. Here's an example for a custom GPT handling Vanderbilt Travel and Business Expense Policies:

Benefits of the Question Refinement Pattern
Reduces Ambiguity: Helps make the user's question clearer.
Improves Accuracy: Ensures the GPT can provide a more accurate answer.
Better User Interaction: Enhances the user's experience by refining their question and reducing misunderstandings.


# 24. Task 24. Using the question refinement pattern helps make interactions with a custom GPT better. 

By suggesting clearer questions, the GPT can give more accurate answers, making it easier for users to get the help they need. 

This pattern is especially useful when the user's question is unclear, helping to clarify their intent and ensure the GPT responds appropriately.

Format of the Question Refinement Pattern

To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

Basic Instruction:

From now on, whenever I ask a question, suggest a better version of the question to use instead.
Optional Instruction:

Prompt me if I would like to use the better version instead.

# 25. Task 25. Using the Alternative Approaches Prompt Pattern

Sometimes, when people ask questions, it's not always clear what the answer should be. This can happen because the information we have isn't clear, or the question itself isn't clear. We want to help solve their problems, but we don't want to give answers that might be wrong or cause trouble. One way to handle this is by using the alternative approaches prompt pattern. This means offering different ways to solve a problem when we aren't sure about the answer.

Setting Up the Custom GPT
Here's what we'll tell our GPT to do:

Analyze the Question: First, check if the question can be clearly answered using the travel policy.
Check for Clarity: If it's not clear, suggest other ways to solve the problem that are definitely okay according to the policy.
Format for Responses
We'll use a clear format:

Unclear Answer: If the answer isn't clear.
Suggestions: Offer three other ways to solve the problem.

How It Helps
By giving these alternative solutions, the GPT helps the user find other ways to solve their problem without breaking any rules. This way, the user can still achieve their goal, like getting more legroom on a flight, without worrying about violating the policy.

Key Points
Boundaries: We set clear limits on what the GPT can answer.
Helpfulness: We still help the user by suggesting other ways to solve their problem.
Safety: We avoid giving risky or unclear answers.
By using the alternative approaches prompt pattern, we balance helping users and staying within safe boundaries.


# 26. Task 26. Format of the Alternative Approaches Pattern

To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

If there are alternative ways to accomplish a task X that I give you, list the best alternate approaches.
(Optional) Compare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach.
(Optional) Include the original way that I asked.
(Optional) Prompt me for which approach I would like to use.
You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate task.

Examples
For every prompt I give you, if there are alternative ways to word a prompt that I give you, list the best alternate wordings. 
Compare/contrast the pros and cons of each wording.
For anything that I ask you to write, determine the underlying problem that I am trying to solve and how I am trying to solve it.
List at least one alternative approach to solve the problem and compare/contrast the approach with the original approach implied by my request to you.

When you ask the GPT to do something, sometimes there are different ways to do it. This pattern helps the GPT suggest other ways to solve the problem or do the task.

Key Steps
Ask for Alternatives: If there are different ways to do something, list the best other ways.
Compare Options: (Optional) Compare the good and bad things about each way.
Keep the Original: (Optional) Include the original way you asked about.
Choose an Option: (Optional) Ask which way you would like to use.

Example Instructions

For every question I ask, if there are different ways to ask it, list the best other ways. Compare the good and bad things about each way.

By following these steps, we can help users find the best way to do things, making sure the answers or solutions are clear and useful.

# 27. Task 27. Cognitive Verifier Pattern

In many cases, answering a user's question effectively requires breaking it down into multiple sub-questions. By addressing these sub-questions first, we can provide a more accurate and comprehensive answer. This approach is known as the Cognitive Verifier Pattern.

Key Steps

Analyze the User's Question: Break it down into three or four sub-questions.

Suggest Sub-Questions: Present these sub-questions to the user.

Combine Answers: Answer the sub-questions and combine the results to provide the overall answer.

Instructions for Custom GPT

To implement the Cognitive Verifier Pattern in a custom GPT, use the following prompt:

Task Definition: You will answer questions about [specific domain].

Sub-Question Analysis: Always start by analyzing the user's question and thinking of three to four sub-questions that could be answered to provide a better overall answer.

User Interaction: Present the sub-questions to the user and ask if they would like to proceed with this approach.

Final Answer: Combine the answers to the sub-questions to address the original question.

When you ask a big question, sometimes we need to break it into smaller questions first. This helps us get a better answer.

Steps
Break Down the Question: Think of three or four smaller questions that help answer the big question.
Ask the Smaller Questions: Show these smaller questions to the user and ask if they want to answer them first.
Combine the Answers: Put together the answers to the smaller questions to answer the big question.
Example
User: Can I get money back for a plane ticket?
GPT: To answer that, let's first think about these questions:

What types of plane tickets can you get money back for?
Are there rules for getting money back for expensive tickets like first-class?
What does the policy say about necessary travel costs?
Would you like to answer these questions first to help with your big question?
By using the Cognitive Verifier Pattern, we can help users get more accurate and complete answers by breaking down complex questions into smaller, more manageable parts.

# 28. Task 28. Format of the Cognitive Verifier Pattern

To use the Cognitive Verifier Pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

When you are asked a question, follow these rules
Generate a number of additional questions that would help more accurately answer the question
Combine the answers to the individual questions to produce the final answer to the overall question

# 29. Task 29. Handling Concept Mapping Ambiguities

When users ask questions, they might use terms that don't appear in the policy, or their terms might have multiple interpretations. This creates ambiguity in how to map these terms to the policy. To handle this, we need to create a strategy for our custom GPT to follow when it encounters such ambiguities. Here’s how to handle this with a custom GPT.

Key Steps to Handle Concept Mapping Ambiguities

Analyze the User's Question: Always start by determining if there are any concepts in the question that cannot be unambiguously mapped to the policy.

Identify Multiple Mappings: If multiple mappings are possible, recognize this as an ambiguity trigger.

State the Ambiguity: Inform the user that the answer is unclear due to ambiguous terms.

Suggest Alternative Questions: Provide alternative questions that use clear concepts from the policy.

Example Implementation

Let's create a custom GPT to handle ambiguities in a travel policy:

![image](https://github.com/iahalkhatib/ChatGPT-Making-Custom-Ai-Assistants/assets/170050432/6687b03e-c8a1-4e67-8c4e-3229b91237bc)

Benefits of This Approach

Clarity: Avoids confusion by not providing uncertain answers.

Safety: Reduces the risk of giving incorrect or misleading information.

Guidance: Helps users by suggesting alternative, clearer questions to ask.

This approach ensures that your custom GPT provides accurate, reliable information and handles ambiguities effectively.

# 30. Task 30. Conflict Resolution Strategy for Multiple Policies

Conflict Resolution Strategy for Multiple Policies
When using multiple documents or policies, we often face conflicts or ambiguities. It is essential to define rules for resolving these conflicts. Let's see how we can handle this in a custom GPT.

Key Steps for Conflict Resolution
Analyze Multiple Documents: Always start by determining if there are conflicts or ambiguities between multiple documents.
Define Resolution Strategies:
Strategy 1: Use the most recent document. If the newer document doesn't cover something, refer to the older document.
Strategy 2: Use only the most recent document and assume it is comprehensive, superseding any older documents.
Example Implementation
Let's create a custom GPT with two different conflict resolution strategies for handling travel policies.

Strategy 1: Referencing Both Documents

Example Conversation:

User: Can I get reimbursed for skydiving?

GPT: Yes, you can be reimbursed for skydiving if it is conducted as a team-building or personal development activity, based on the older policy.

Strategy 2: Using Only the Most Recent Document

Example Conversation:

User: Can I get reimbursed for skydiving?

GPT: Skydiving expenses are generally considered personal expenses and are not eligible for reimbursement, based on the most recent policy.

Benefits of Defining Conflict Resolution Strategies

Clarity: Avoids confusion by having clear rules for resolving conflicts.

Consistency: Ensures consistent answers based on the defined strategy.

Reliability: Provides reliable and accurate information by following a clear resolution strategy.

By implementing these conflict resolution strategies, we ensure that our custom GPT can handle ambiguities effectively and provide accurate, consistent answers.

# 31. Task 31. Responsibility and Accountability for Custom GPTs

When deploying custom GPTs, you must understand that you are effectively giving them the identity of your organization or yourself. These bots represent you in the world, and you need to stand behind their actions.

Key Considerations
Ownership: You are responsible for everything the bot does. You can't blame the bot for mistakes; responsibility falls on you or your organization.

Internal vs. External Use:

Internal Use: Mistakes are easier to manage and fix within your organization.
External Use: Mistakes can have significant consequences, including legal and reputational damage.
Case Study: Air Canada

Scenario: Air Canada’s chatbot promised a discount that the company later refused to honor.
Outcome: The court ruled in favor of the customer, holding Air Canada accountable for the chatbot’s promise. This highlights the importance of standing behind your AI’s actions.
Best Practices
Careful Planning: Think through the capabilities and scope of your GPT. Ensure it aligns with your brand values and can handle its tasks effectively.

Testing: Thoroughly test the bot before deployment. Ensure it can perform its functions accurately and reliably.

Legal and Reputational Impact: Be aware of the potential legal and reputational risks associated with your custom GPT’s actions. Plan for contingencies.

Brand Representation: Your GPT represents your brand. Ensure its actions and responses reflect positively on your organization.

Practical Steps
Define Scope and Functionality:

Clearly outline what the GPT can and cannot do.
Limit its scope to areas where it can perform reliably.
Continuous Monitoring and Updates:

Regularly monitor the GPT’s performance.
Update and refine its knowledge base to handle new situations.
Legal Preparedness:

Consult legal experts to understand the implications of deploying a custom GPT.
Prepare policies to address potential issues.

Scenario Examples:

User: Can I get a discount for booking in advance?

GPT: The answer is not clear based on the current policy. Please contact our support team for accurate information.

User: Can I be reimbursed for premium economy seats?

GPT: According to our latest travel policy, you can be reimbursed for premium economy seats if they meet the business travel requirements. Please check with your department for approval.

By carefully planning, testing, and monitoring your custom GPTs, you can ensure they serve your organization effectively while minimizing risks.

# 32. Task 32. Adversarial Testing for Custom GPTs

When building a custom GPT for public use, you need to consider adversarial testing. This involves checking if someone can manipulate the GPT to say or do inappropriate things. If you're using it internally with trusted users, you might skip this step, but for public-facing bots, it's essential.

Key Points
Manipulative Inputs:

Test if users can trick your GPT into making inappropriate statements.
Example: A user might try to get your GPT to badmouth another organization.
Guardrails:

Ensure your GPT has strong guardrails to prevent manipulation.
Example: Disable unnecessary capabilities like image generation to avoid misuse.
Testing Scenarios:

Create various scenarios where users might try to manipulate the GPT.
Example: Asking the GPT to generate images or make controversial statements.
Real-world Example:

A GPT could be manipulated to make inappropriate comments about another organization.
Example: "University A is unethical for charging high prices for water."
Practical Steps
Analyze Potential Risks:

Identify capabilities that could be exploited.
Example: Disable image generation if not necessary.
Create Adversarial Tests:

Develop scenarios to test if the GPT can be tricked.
Example: Can the GPT generate an image when it shouldn't?
Refine Guardrails:

Strengthen the GPT's guardrails based on test results.
Example: If the GPT makes inappropriate comments, refine the rules to prevent this.
Continuous Monitoring:

Regularly test and update the GPT to ensure it remains secure.
Example: Periodically check for new ways users might try to manipulate the system.

Example Scenarios

Manipulative Input Example:
